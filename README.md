Simple math game

The game is simple; you have to sum all 5 numbers to get the correct result.

It's really a simple game I wrote in Swift for fun; to work correctly you have to add you own sound, for example every time the function 'fx' is called you need to specify the name of the sound (file) you want to play:

fx("Pop")
fx("Glass")
fx("fail")

Enjoy
